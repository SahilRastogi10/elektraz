The 2025 IISE Optimization Hackathon
Sponsored by: AZ 70 IISE Professional Organization
Background:
A Hackathon is a competition designed to solve a problem and demonstrate technical skills. The team is given 24 hours to solve the problem within the constraints given. Normally associated with coding, the IISE hackathon is concentrating on creating and solving an optimization issue.
Overview:
The Hackathon will take place over a 24 hour period
The 24 hour period starts after this meeting is adjourned and the timer starts by the sponsors
After the 24 hour period, teams will present their problem and solution to the sponsors
Points will be given based on a myriad of parameters, listed later
Prizes will vary based on placement in the competition
Competition is open to all students, but at least one person with Operations Research understanding for a team is highly suggested
Optimization Details:
The theme for this competition is: Electricity in and to Arizona
Its is up to the team to decide on a solution and then optimize it
Example using "Animal Deaths in Arizona":
Team decides that small bridges across highways is the way to reduce animal deaths
They find the normal cost of building an animal bridge from other states
They use public data to find where animals cross the most in Arizona
They utilize the Arizona parks budget information to find how much money is available
Using the money, they optimize how many animals can be saved based on the number of bridges that could be built
Judging and Points
The team with the highest average points will win, based on the judge's assessment
Points will be given in these categories
Defining the problem within the theme (Variable Points)
Team Setup (Fixed Bonus Points)
o Use of public information (Fixed Points)
Optimizing Process (Variable Points)
Optimization Model (Variable Points)
Presentation (Variable Points)
Team Setup Bonus Points:
Having a mix of Graduate and Undergraduate students
Having more than I type of degree available (additional points for having a mix for all four)
Defining the problem within the theme
Defining a creative solution within the theme
o Showing that it could actually be accomplished
o Details for the way the problem is defined
Use of Public Information
Showing at least two public data sets used to for the optimization problem
Optimizing
Rules:
Clearly defining the model
Showing the results and program used
Difficulty of the model used with multiple variables
Presentation
A short explanation of the problem set and solution
A quick report detailing the data, model, and references
Creativity for showing results
Anything can be used to helping develop the solution, including Al
All data utilized must be public, accessible, and from reputable sources
An optimization program must be used to show the solution with real data
Normal industry ethical standards apply, such as: no stealing work from other teams, no sabotaging their work, and no making up data
Additional Items to Consider:
A team should have a variety of skills, such as someone that can do quick research and someone that can run a model quickly
Even if you don't win the competition, this is a differentiator for your resume and future job opportunities
"Perfection is the enemy of excellence"; Having a completed project is better than spending too much time defining the "perfect" solution and not finishing
Defining the initial solution can be the hardest part, so brainstorm that aspect before trying to start other work
